Spoonman
And all my friends are skeletons
(They beat the rhythm with their bones)
Spoonman
Oh, hmm
Spoonman, come together with your hands
Save me, I'm together with your plan
Save me
Save
Save me
Save me, yeah
Save
With your
With your hands
With your hands

Hands
Come on while I get off
Spoonman, come together with your hands
Save me, I'm together with your plan
Save me

With your, with your hands
Feel the rhythm with your hands
(Steal the rhythm while you can)
Spoonman
