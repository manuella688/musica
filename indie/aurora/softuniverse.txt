There's ice in my water
And when I drink, it cuts my tongue
There's glass on the playground
It cuts my skin when I run
And from the dark, into the light
I saw a stone burst into life
And in the corner of your eye
I saw a dream that never died
Speak to me, speak to me
With love in your words
Make for me, make for me
A soft universe
My body falls off the side of a bed
And now I know what love feels like
Don't let me turn it to pain
All of this is loveliness
Chaos came, we laid our head
Down on the feather cotton bed
We find a heart and catch a breath
Let the universe go red
Speak to me, speak to me
With love in your words
Make for me, make for me
A soft universe
Speak to me, speak to me
With, with
Make for me, make for me
A soft universe
Soft universe
Soft universe
Soft universe
Soft universe
Soft universe
Soft universe
Soft universe
Soft universe
Soft universe
