Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You heard the crickets of the early eve
They lurk around the opening in twos and threes
Clementine told you not to move with the breeze
I'll take you down to places where we dare not speak
The red light in the doorway says she's armed (She's armed)
But boy go try your luck and you might get past (Might get past)
Step into the dwelling of the liger's mouth
Peer into the panic for a kick and swell
You know you shouldn't be there but it's way past bed
There's comfort in the fingers of your good intent
You know you shouldn't be there but your money's all spent
You've got your reputation and your good intent
Your good intent
Ooh, ooh, ohh
Out to feed a habit when you sowed that seed
Nothing made you feel out of the ordinary
But the air turns sombre and the night took thee
Took you on a waltz of hypocrisy
She broke your bones, now you're lying in the dirt
The shadow of a hunter under your torture
It's not enough to say it's not what's in your heart
You've tainted every moment till death do we part
I know you didn't mean it, boy you meant so well
The pennies are cascading down your wishing well (Down your wishing well)
I know you didn't mean it when you counted to ten
You're slipping through the fingers of your good intent
I know you didn't mean it, boy you meant so well
The pennies are cascading down your wishing well
I know you didn't mean it when you counted to ten
You've got your reputation and your good intent
Such a good intent
Ooh, ooh
It's not enough to hope for the best
It's not enough to lie there on a breast
The liger's on the prowl now you've pulled its strings
One false move and soon you're playing dice for a-
